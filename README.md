# QML-Prosody-Analysis

In this work, with a Bayesian regression approach we quantify both the main effects of these factors and their interaction, providing insight into whether emotional modulation of F0 differs between male and female speakers. According to our findings, females consistently exhibit a higher F0 compared to male speakers and also larger pitch increases from a neutral baseline when in high-arousal emotional states, indicating that emotional modulation of F0 differs between sexes.

As a secondary contribution, we present a curated dataset containing demographic information, acoustic features (mean F0, standard deviation, and interquartile range), and metadata for 7,442 emotional speech samples from the CREMA-D corpus. This dataset is publicly available and can be used for future research and pedagogical purposes in the Quantitative Methods for Linguistics and English Language Course.
